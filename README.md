# TheWasteFoodProject
This project aims to make the donation process, quick and convenient. It brings the Food Donors and the Food Takers (FNUs) closer through this website. This project makes the food donation process super easy by connecting the food donors to all those food needing institutions in Karachi. Now, one can easily donate their leftover food to NGOs by simply posting on this website. When a post is added on our website, all the FNUs receive a text message about your leftover food. The FNU nearest to your home will contact you and will pick up the food. The process of posting on our website takes less than a minute, that makes the donation process easy.

Prevent food waste by creating an interactive multi-channel system that will allow people with surplus excess foods from Weddings , Parties, and other events, to contact 'No Food Waste' to donate food, as well as for hungry individuals and institutions requiring food supplies to request help from 'No Food Waste'

>> Weddings
>> Parties, &
>> Other events

can contact 'No Food Waste' for donating food to the individuals, institutions in need of food. The food distribution is done for places like,

>> Orphanages
>> Homeless
>> Poor areas in the society
>> General Hospitals
>> Child care

A applicaiton that will enable the 3 parties to communicate in an effective manner, where

>> Donors - people with excess food should be able to post their food availability details via the App
>> Volunteers, Drivers - Can accept the food donation, via the app and deliver the food
>> Volunteers - Can map the areas/places that are in need of food
Note: Delivery of food will be offline to the app.
